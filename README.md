# Conway's Game Of Life

### A quick implimentation of Conways Game of life in JavaScript and HTML.

The game follows four simple rules and demonstrates emergent behavior.
##### The Rules
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.

2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.

4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
